bashrc

Additions to the .bashrc file

I have taken the sample .bashrc file from Emmanuel Rouat and added some of my own functions
and changed the appearance.

Some of the aliases I made are only for yum, so this must be changed when working with 
another packaging manager.

More will be done in the future, as soon as I get new ideas.
